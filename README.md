# Shortest Path Visualization

A Python application for visualizing and finding the shortest path in a graph.

# Code Description

This code is a Python application built using the Tkinter library for GUI. It allows users to create a graph of nodes and edges, specify source and destination nodes, and find the shortest path using various algorithms, including Bellman-Ford, Dijkstra, and A*.

# Usage Instructions

1. Install Python and the required libraries (Tkinter, heapq).

2. Run the application by executing `python main.py`.

3. Follow the on-screen prompts to create a graph, select algorithms, and find the shortest path.
